# Coachbot

Welcome to the **Coachbot**, a web-based tool that generates personalized workout plans based on user inputs. This app is designed to provide users with a customized training plan based on their goals, preferences, and personal details such as fitness level, frequency, equipment, and intensity. 

The app leverages Flask for web interactions, WeasyPrint to create downloadable PDFs, and a custom `CoachBot` AI to generate workout plans.

## Features

- **Form-Based Input**: Users fill out a form with their details (name, age, weight, fitness goals, etc.), and the app generates a tailored gym plan.
- **AI-Powered Response**: The workout plan is generated by an AI model (`CoachBot`) which interprets the userâ€™s input and returns a personalized gym plan.
- **Downloadable PDF**: Users can download their generated gym plan as a professionally formatted PDF.
  
## Requirements

- **Python** (3.8+)
- Flask
- WeasyPrint
- dotenv

You can install the dependencies via `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask WeasyPrint python-dotenv
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gymplan-generator-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:  
   Ensure a `.env` file exists with your environment settings. For example, you can add your appâ€™s secret key:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=supersecretkey
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the appâ€™s homepage (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
2. Fill out the form with your personal details such as name, age, weight, fitness level, goals, and training preferences.
3. Submit the form to receive a personalized gym plan generated by the AI (`CoachBot`).
4. You can download the gym plan as a PDF by clicking on the "Download PDF" button.

## Customization

You can easily customize the form fields or adjust the way the gym plan is generated by editing the relevant sections in `app.py` or modifying the `CoachBot` in `coachbot.py`.

### Changing Templates

- To modify the user interface, edit `templates/index2.html`.
- The structure of the generated gym plan (HTML and PDF) is defined in `config.py` with `gymplan_header` and `gymplan_tail` for the PDF's header and footer.

### Adding New Fields

To add new fields to the form:
1. Add the new input field in the HTML (`index2.html`).
2. Update the form processing logic in the `/generate_gymplan` route of `app.py`.
